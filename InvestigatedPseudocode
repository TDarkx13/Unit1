Input 100  positive (>=0) numbers.  Add up the numbers, and print the total.

If a negative number is encountered, the program should terminate, and print the sum so far.

			sum=sum+number
			count=count+1
			input number

100 students sit a 'before' exam, and their marks can be assumed to be in the array b.  Later, they do an 'after' exam, and those marks are in a.
Print the subscript number (i.e in range 1 to 100) of the student who:
			a)	got the lowest mark overall (before + after)
			b)	improved the most between b and a.

	a)

			if a[n]+b[n] <lowvalue
				lowvalue=a[n]+b[n]
				lowposition=n

		endfor
		display lowposition
  END
